### Dataset_1 represents PeMS04 (partial), and dataset_2 represents PeMS08(partial).

#### In order to ensure the validity and accuracy of the experimental results, I selected some data from PeMS04 and PeMS08 as the experimental data set for this paper. Dataset_1 selected weekday data for the first six days from PeMS04 and dataset_2 is the first six days including working day and holidays.
